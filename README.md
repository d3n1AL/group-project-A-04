### Introduction

A place to post recipes, but without the pages and pages of backstory that all cooking webpages now have to force you to scroll through ads. Recipes would include a set of ingredients and directions, as well as images, possible videos, etc.

Users are ables to add new recipies, ingredients, quantities, directions, and images; "favorite", "like", and review recipes; and "fork" recipes — meaning taking an existing recipes, modifying it, and references the original recipe.
