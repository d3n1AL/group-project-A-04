# Create your tests here.

# manage.py test polls looks for tests in the polls app
# finds subclass of the TestCase class
# creates special database for testing
# looks for test methodsâ€” one whose names begin with test
# runs the functions below, returns results of tests through various asserts

# Good rules-of-thumb include having:
# a separate TestClass for each model or view
# a separate test method for each set of conditions you want to test
# test method names that describe their function from the tutorial

# Remember: no code can be pushed to main without tests!

    # recipes have author

    # recipes have list of ingredients/quantities

    # publishing
    # recipes cannot be published without: title, author, ingredients/quantities, and steps
    # recipes can be published without: description
    # only the author can access the URL until it is published

    # editing
    # only the author can edit the recipe
    # editable fields: title, description, ingredients/quantities, steps
    # think about creating a separate update date field?

    # deleting
    # only the author can delete the recipe
    # author should be prompted for a second time before deleting the recipe
